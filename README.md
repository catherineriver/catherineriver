<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Catherine.</h1>
<h3 align="center">A frontend developer by day and UI/UX designer by night.</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m currently working at <a href="https://doxa.team/" target="_blank">DOXA</a>, diving deep into the Vue stack. Itâ€™s also the place where I get better at design and UI. All new components and pages design is crafted by me. One of my proudest moments with this team was <a href="https://noncharity.doxa.team/" target="_blank">NonCharity</a>, which won the <a href="https://redkollegia.org/archives/text/neblagotvori-telnost-kak-sistema-prezidentskih-grantov-vynuzhdaet-rossijskoe-obshhestvo-obsluzhivat-vojnu" target="_blank">Redkollegiya award</a>. Itâ€™s an independent award established to support free professional journalism in Russia.</p>

<p>Additionally, I clinched a win at the <a href="https://internetborders.net/" target="_blank">Â«Internet Without BordersÂ» hackathon</a> in Tool development panel challenge from Ceno. For the challenge, I was tasked with redesigning and developing functionalities for a page for Ceno Browser site. This win is even more special because it was my first-ever hackathon and my inaugural trip to Amsterdam.
Besides my day job, I love taking on freelance gigs, which allows me to mix things up and face new challenges. Freelancing lets me play around with modern technologies and learn new ones.</p>
