<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Catherine.</h1>
<h3 align="center">A frontend developer by day and UI/UX designer by night.</h3>
<p>I work daily with .vue, .tsx, .ts, .js, .html, .css</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently working at DOXA, diving deep into the Vue stack. Itâ€™s also the place where I get better at design and UI.
One of my proudest moments with this team was [NonCharity](https://noncharity.doxa.team/), which won the [Redkollegiya award](https://redkollegia.org/archives/text/neblagotvori-telnost-kak-sistema-prezidentskih-grantov-vynuzhdaet-rossijskoe-obshhestvo-obsluzhivat-vojnu). Itâ€™s an independent award established to support free professional journalism in Russia.</p>

<p>Additionally, I clinched a win at the [Â«Internet Without BordersÂ» hackathon](https://internetborders.net/) in Tool development panel challenge from Ceno. For the challenge, I was tasked with redesigning and developing functionalities for a page for Ceno Browser site. This win is even more special because it was my first-ever hackathon and my inaugural trip to Amsterdam.
Besides my day job, I love taking on freelance gigs, which allows me to mix things up and face new challenges. Freelancing lets me play around with modern technologies and learn new ones.</p>
